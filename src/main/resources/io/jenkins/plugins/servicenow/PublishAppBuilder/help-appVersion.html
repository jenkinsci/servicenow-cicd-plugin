(MAJOR.MINOR), eg. 1.0 (the third number will be automatically added with build number, what gives eg. 1.0.106). or you can provide an exact version (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH), e.g. 1.0.1.<br/>If the version number is passed, the publish process uses that version and updates the local application version if different. If the version number is not passed, the publish process uses the current version of the local application
